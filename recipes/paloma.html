    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> While many think of the margarita as the most traditional Mexican drink, the paloma is the real star of the show! Grilled grapefruit and lime take this traditional Mexican cocktail to the next level, giving it the perfect mix of sweet, salty, and smoky. Be sure to save all the juices accumulated while grilling
         to get the richest, smokiest flavor in your drink.</p>
